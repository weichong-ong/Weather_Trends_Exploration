# Explore Weather Trends Project
## Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Goal
The goal is to create visualization about the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

## Steps
1. Extract the data from the database by writing SQL queries.
2. Create a line chart that compares city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.
3. Plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
4. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
5. The following questions will be answered through the observations:
   * Is city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
   * How do the changes in the city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
   * What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
